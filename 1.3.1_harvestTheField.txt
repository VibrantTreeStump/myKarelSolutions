/*

If you're struggling with this task, read this first:

I found it helpful to first write down every single step Karel should
take and then find his patterns in my notes, instead of while watching him.

I wrote 'mf' for 'move forward', 'tl' for 'turn left', 'tr' for 'turn right',
'pu' for 'pick up' and 'ta' for 'turn around'.

With that notation the first five steps look like this: mf, pu, tr, mf, tl
